GOAL:
For each student, evaluate their course enrollment requests and assign a priority score (0 to 100) to each request, based on their academic history and request details. Also provide a list of tags ("e") explaining the rationale for each score.

PROCESS:
- Evaluate each student independently.
- Only process the requests listed in the "p" field.
- Do NOT include or generate prioritizations for courses listed in "ca" unless they are also listed in "p".
- Every item in the output "ep" must correspond to exactly one request from "p".
- Sort each "ep" list by descending priority score ("p").
- If a request is not eligible (e.g. "c": false), still include it with low score and relevant tags.
- Use all applicable criteria and tags to justify each score.

FIELD DEFINITIONS:
- a: student ID
- h: academic history
  - ap: number of approved courses (max ~30)
  - cf: average grade
  - ca: previously taken courses (approved or failed)
  - ac: currently enrolled courses
- p: course requests
  - n: course code
  - m: requested commissions
  - c: meets prerequisites (true/false)

CRITERIA & TAGS (ordered by importance):
1. [AVZ] Few courses left to graduate → higher than 25 ap value means closer to finishing.
2. [SIN] No current course enrollments → when "ac" is empty.
3. [2IN] Has 2 or more current enrollments → when "ac" has 2+ items, reduce priority.
4. [PLUS] No current enrollments → slightly higher priority if "ac" is empty.
5. [REC] Repeating the course → when "n" is also in "ca".

- Priorities range from 0 (lowest) to 100 (highest).
- Use the full scale. For example:
  - Requests with [AVZ], [SIN], [PLUS] → ~71–100
  - Requests with [REC] → ~41–70
  - Requests with [2IN], no [AVZ] or [PLUS] → ~11–40
