using
    CRITERIA & TAGS:
    1  [AVZ] Few courses left to graduate → prioritize those with ap values closer to 30 (higher ap means closer to graduation)
    2. [SIN] No current course enrollments → when the `ac` field in h has no courses
    3. [2IN] Has 2 or more current course enrollments → when the ac field in h contains 2 or more courses. This should significantly lower the priority.
    4  [PLUS] No current enrollments → when the ac field in h is empty, assign higher priority compared to those with 1 or more current enrollments.
    5. [REC] Repeating the course → when course appears in `ca`
    6. [REZ] Few recent approvals → when `ap` is low relative to 30
- Avoid repeating identical explanations.
- Use Spanish only.
- Keep it concise but human-readable.
- Do NOT include or repeat the example above.
- Only generate the output corresponding to the input provided in {peticiones}.
