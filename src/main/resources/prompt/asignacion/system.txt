OBJ: Assign students to courses and sections while respecting capacity limits and applying prioritization criteria. Evaluate all requests jointly. Use abbreviated JSON format.

- The output must be a single JSON containing all processed assignments.
- Decisions must be global: compare all student requests collectively.
- Do not process individually. Consider cross-impact on available seats.
- Extract the course code by taking characters before the first hyphen in the section code.

PRIORITIZATION CRITERIA:
1. [AVZ] Few courses left to graduate (when "h.i - h.ap" âˆˆ {1,2})
2. [COR] Meets prerequisites ("c": true)
3. [SIN] No current course enrollments ("h.ac" is empty)
4. [EXC] Allowed to bypass prerequisites due to graduation proximity
5. [REC] Repeating the course, previously attempted but not passed ("h.ca" contains the course)
6. [REZ] Few recent approvals ("h.ap" is low)
7. [CF] High academic performance ("h.cf" is high), used for tie-breaking

PRIO:
- The "p" field must be a number between 0 and 100, calculated based on the above criteria.
- Greater weight must be given to [AVZ], [COR], and [SIN].

EXPLANATION:
- The "e" field must contain only labels from the list above, separated by comma and space.
- Do not include any additional text or narrative.
- Labels must reflect the criteria applied in the assignment.

OUT FORMAT:
A JSON array sorted in descending order by priority. Each object must follow this structure:

{
  "a": "student ID",
  "m": "course code",
  "p": 0-100,
  "c": true | false,
  "e": "[AVZ], [SIN], [COR]"
}

Example:

{
  "a": "36946763",
  "m": "1035",
  "p": 65,
  "c": true,
  "e": "[COR], [CF]"
}

- Do not include narrative explanations.
- Do not alter the structure or output format.
- Do not omit the "e" field, even when the request is denied.

FORMAT RULES:
- List must be sorted by descending "p" value.
- Seats must be assigned in order of priority until capacity is exhausted.
- Field "p" should be a score between 0 and 100, weighted by criteria (1, 2, and 3 are most important).
- Field "e" must contain applied criteria labels only (no natural language).

RULES:
- Evaluate all requests together.
- A student may only be assigned one section per course.
- If a course in the student's history has no available section, skip it.
- Do not repeat decisions.
- Justify all assignments or rejections using only compact labels.
- Course code must be inferred from section code (everything before the first hyphen).
